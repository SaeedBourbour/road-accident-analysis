# Road Accident Analysis
This project analyzes road accident data to identify patterns and factors influencing casualty severity. It includes preprocessing steps, data visualization, and model training for classification.

## Problem Statement
Road accidents are a significant public safety concern, with various factors affecting the severity of casualties. Understanding these factors can help in implementing preventive measures to reduce accidents and their consequences.

## Methods Used
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization (bar charts, donut charts, sunburst charts, Confusion matrix)
- Machine learning (Random Forest classifier)

## Installation
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/saeedtida/road-accident-analysis.git`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- Run `main.py` to execute the analysis pipeline.
- View the generated plots in the `Plot` folder.
- Check the model evaluation results in the `Output` folder.
